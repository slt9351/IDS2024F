1. What is the fastest component of a computer memory?  
   The CPU register
2. Why is modern computer memory comprised of a multilevel (hierarchical) structure?

5. What is smallest unit of information in computers? (Hint: Recall our computer programming lecture)  
   A bit  
6. Why have humans chosen the binary numbers (0 and 1) to represent data in computer  
   Because 0 and 1 are easy to represent electronically and are more efficient.  
7. What is the typical speed of contemporary computer memory registers?  
   2.8 GHz  
8. What decade was the first digital computer built?  
   In the 1940's.  
9.What decade was the first general-purpose digital computer built?  
  In the 1940's  
10. What is a fixed program computer?  
  A computer that has to be rewired to preform a new task.  
11. Name an example of modern-day fixed program computer.     
    A calculator    
 12. What is the difference between declarative and imperative knowledge?  
    Declarative knowlege is a statement of fact while imperative knowledge is intructions to do something.
13. Classify the following statements as imperative or declarative knowledge.  
   a. The letter B is the second letter in the English alphabet.  
      Declarative  
   b. Overcast sky conditions are more likely to cause rain.

    The ENIAC
16. Name a computer programming language whose evolution and popularity is tightly coupled with the field of Bioinformatics.
        Python
17. Name a computer programming language whose evolution and popularity is tightly coupled with the field of Numerical Computing, Atmospheric Science, Plasma Sciences, and Aerospace Engineering, among others.
    Fortran
18. Name the five major components of a modern digital computer.

19. Name an example of fixed-program computer.
    A calculator
20. Order the following languages chronologically according to their birth date. (Hint: Use the diagrams from our lecture notes) Java, COBOL, C++, Python, Fortran, B
    Fortran, COBOL, B, C++, Java, Python
21.(A) What is the closest human-readable programming language to machine code (i.e., binary numbers)?
      Assembly  
    (B) Does it need interpretation in order to become machine-comprehensible?
    It does not need interpretation since it is so close to machine code
22. (A) Name the oldest high-level programming language that is still in active daily use.  
         Fortran  
   (B) Approximately how many decades is it old? (±15 years is acceptable answer. the decade Tt was created is also an acceptable answer.)  
   67 years old
23. (A) Name a second-generation programming language.  
         Assembly  
   (B) Which language-generation are Fortran, C, C++, MATLAB, Python, R?  
         Third and fourth generation
24. In what decades C, C++, MATLAB, and Python were created, respectively? (Hint: Use the diagrams from our lecture notes)  
      1970s, 1980s, 1980s, 1990s
25. Name an ancestor programming language of C (Hint: Use the diagrams from our lecture notes).
    B
26. Name a programming language ancestor of C++ (Hint: Use the diagrams from our lecture notes).
   C with classes.
27. Name a programming language ancestor of MATLAB and a programming language ancestor of Python (Hint: Use the diagrams from our lecture notes).
    Fortran and C
28. How do you define logarithm? Explain with a simple example just as we did in class.
    A logarithm finds what power a number must be raised to to find the given number.  
29. Consider the following summation:
S=3+6+9+…+93+96+99 .

What is the value of S? Explain your novel strategy to get your answer.
(Hint: Recall the chessboard problems in our HW and class discussions. How did we solve them in class? There are 33
 numbers in the summation above.)  
    The value of s is 1683.  
30. Which memory device is longer lasting: magnetic tapes or HDD (Hard-Disk Drives)? How many years approximately each one last (a rough reasonable estimate is good enough)?
   Magnetic tapes, 3 years
31. Can you name a fixed-program computer that existed for centuries before the invention of the first digital computer?  
   FERMIAC  
32.  Consider the following multiplication:
S=101×102×103×…×10100 .What is the value of S? Explain your novel strategy to get your answer.
