1. What is the fastest component of a computer memory?  
   The CPU register
2. Why is modern computer memory comprised of a multilevel (hierarchical) structure?   
  So the CPU can predict and fetch the data or intructions from the slower but larger levels of memory.
3. What is the slowest kind of computer storage device?
   The disk
4. Name the hierarchy of the memory of modern computers, from the smallest to the largest memory size.
   CPU, L1 cache, L2 cache, L3 cache, DRAM, disk
5. What is smallest unit of information in computers? (Hint: Recall our computer programming lecture)
   A bit
6. Why have humans chosen the binary numbers (0 and 1) to represent data in computer
   Because 0 and 1 are easy to represent electronically and are more efficient.
7. What is the typical speed of contemporary computer memory registers?
   2.8 GHz
8. What decade was the first digital computer built?
   In the 1940's.
9.What decade was the first general-purpose digital computer built?
  In the 1940's
10. What is a fixed program computer?
  A computer that has to be rewired to preform a new task.
11. Name an example of modern-day fixed program computer.
    A calculator
