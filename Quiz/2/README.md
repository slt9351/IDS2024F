1. What is the fastest component of a computer memory?  
   The CPU register
2. Why is modern computer memory comprised of a multilevel (hierarchical) structure?   
  So the CPU can predict and fetch the data or intructions from the slower but larger levels of memory.  
3. What is the slowest kind of computer storage device?  
   The disk  
4. Name the hierarchy of the memory of modern computers, from the smallest to the largest memory size.

5. What is smallest unit of information in computers? (Hint: Recall our computer programming lecture)  
   A bit  
6. Why have humans chosen the binary numbers (0 and 1) to represent data in computer  
   Because 0 and 1 are easy to represent electronically and are more efficient.
