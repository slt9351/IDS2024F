2. Name four major historical definitions of Probability.  
  classical, emperical, subjective and axiomatic  
3. Which school(s) of thought define probability as the degree of belief?  
  Classical probability   
4. Which school(s) of thought define probability as the relative frequency of occurrence?  
  frequentist probability  
5. Which probability definition(s), among those we have discussed in class, allow defining the Probability of the existence of God? Why?  
  Bayesian probability  
6. Is Bayesian Inference a subset of the Frequentist Inference methods? Why?  
  No, they are different approaches to probability.  
7. Which inference methodology allows the inclusion of expert knowledge in data analysis and decision-making?  
  Bayesian inference.  
8. Why is Bayesian Probability Theory more popular among physicists and engineers and Frequentist Probability Theory more popular among Biologists and Social Scientists?    
   
9. When did the first modern definition of Probability appear in history?  
 1700  
10. What kinds of uncertainty exist in our experiments?    
    Uncertainty exists in our lack of knowledge.  
11. Suppose there is a donkey outside the classroom. I ask you what you observe and tell me what you see. You tell me that you see a horse. What kind of uncertainty is involved in your observation?  
  The uncertainty is my lack of knowledge of whether it is a horse or donkey.  
12. what are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
    Aesthetics are mapping data sets into visuals or graphics.  
13. Name the two major classes of aesthetics.  
  Aesthetics that can represent continuous data and aesthetics that cannot.  
14. What is the difference between factors and levels?  
    Levels are a subset of factors. Factors are qualitative data and levels are the categories within the factors.  
15. Name the two major types of data and provide an example for each category.  
  Continuous and Discrete. Continuous data would be a decimal like hours and discrete would be whole numbers for example       dates.  
16. What is the common name for variables holding data?  
  Factors.  
17. Provide examples of ordered and unordered data.  
   Ordered data would be academic grades and unordered data would be a series of numbers with no hierarchy.  
18. Name four different color scales and explain their most appropriate usage.  
    Colorbrew Blues could be used to show density on a map. Heat could be used to show temperature on a map. Grays with accent could be used to show good, bad, and neutral spending on an excel sheet. CARTO earth could be used to show topography on a map.  
19. Professional Data Scientists tend to avoid 3D plots in their visualizations. Why?  
  It messes with the proportion of the graph or visual and makes it less effective.    
20. Recall our class discussions on the kinds of data, for example, numerical vs. categorical.  
Describe an example dataset that could be classified as either numerical or categorical, depending on how it is represented.  
    The date could be categorical or numerical  
21. Is color a categorical/unordered or quantitative/ordered aesthetics?    
    Color is categorical/unordered  
22. Graph E would be best for graphing a coordinate since it is too scale. Any other graph would warp location.   
23. The best color palatte would be the first one since humans associate red with bad and green with good. This color palette would communicate its meaning effectivley.  
24. Which city’s temperature is the least varying throughout the year (mostly the same temperature)?  
    San Diego   
Which city’s temperature is the wildest varying throughout the year (sometimes relatively very hot or some times relatively very cold)?
Death Valley  
Which city the hottest in the month of January?
San Diego  
Which city the coolest in the month of July?
San Diego
25. Which classes of color scales the following color-mappings belong to?  
    a) qualitative color scale  
    b)sequential color scale  
    c)diverging color scale  
    d)accent color scales
26. What kind of data set can be best visualized in polar coordinates?
  Periodic data sets.
27. Which color scale has been used in the following visualization?
    CARTO earth
28. What is ugly in the following graph?
  The text is sideways and hard to read.
29. a)Just by looking at this graph, do you think the temperature of Earth will increase or decrease in the following decades?
    The temperature will increase.
    b)Approximately, how much hotter or cooler do you think Earth will be in 2050 with respect to the average temperatures during 1951-1980 (the zero-anomaly temperature)? Express your answer in units of Celsius or Fahrenheit if you like (1
 Celsius is about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit).
    The temperature will likely increase 1 degree celcius
