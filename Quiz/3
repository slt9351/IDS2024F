1.Name and describe briefly the steps involved in scientific inference.
  Observational data, observe a problem. Model construction, create a model using data. Prediction, use data to predict. 
2. Name the three pillars of science
  Experimental, Theory, and Computation+Data
3. Describe three different major applications of the third pillar of science with respect to the first two.
  Predictive computing for hypothesis/theory and prediction. Numerical simulation for when obeservational data is not available. Machine learning for wjere theory is not available. 
4. Name the two different categories of logical reasoning and provide and example of each class.
  Deductive and plausible reasoning. For deductive reasoning I would say my logic is "if I am sick then you are sick". The truth is I am sick so it is a fact that you are also sick. 
  For Plausible reasoning I would say my logic is "if I am sick you are sick". The truth is I am sick so it is plausible that you are sick but it is not a fact.
5. What is the relationship between data and reality? Can we observe reality?
  We can observe reality and we can observe data. Data is driven by observations of reality.
6. What is the difference between model validation and calibration?
  Model calibration sets and modifies the parameters while validation evaluates the already set parameters. 
7. Is logical implication the same as physical causation? Explain with an example.
  They are not the same. An example is the logic " there is rain and the floor is wet. The floor is wet so there must have been rain" The floor being wet is not enough evidence to say that there was rain. 
8. Who is the Boolean algebra named after?
  George Boole
11. What does it mean if two Boolean propositions are equal?
  They are equally plausible 
12. What is the result of adding two propositions that complement each other?
Explain you answer with an example.
