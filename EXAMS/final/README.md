1. What is the difference between observational data and reality (truth)?    
Observational Data is based on our own perception while Reality is based on what is truly happening.   
2. What are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
Data mapped into quantifiable features. Aesthetics include those that can represent data and those than cannot.  
3.Best visualization color    
   The first color set is better since red and green represent good and bad and it would convey a messgae clearly.    
4. Visualization color scales  
   a)qualitative color scale, represents data with no intrinsic order  
   b)sequential color scales, data values like temperature and heat  
   c) diverging color scale, represent two endpoints and neutral midpoint    
   d) accent color scale, used to highlight   
5. Which one(s) of the following statements are valid or invalid. Why?    
This person is breathing. =This person is inhaling and exhaling.  
  This is valid  
This person is breathing. ≡This person is inhaling and exhaling.   
This is valid, to breath you must inhale exhale.   
This person is conscious. ≡This person is breathing.  
THis is invalid, to be concious you dont have to be breathing    
This person is conscious. = This person is breathing.  
This is valid, you can be concious and breathe.    
It is rainy. ≡The sky is cloudy.  
   This is invalid, it is not always cloudy when raining.    
It is rainy. =The sky is cloudy.  
This is valid  
6. Name the three pillars of science.
   Experiment, theory, and Computation + Data
7. Is logical implication the same as physical causation? Explain with a real-world example.  
   No, Logical implication might say that because the ground is wet it rained, but physical causation would say that the sprinklers broke. They are not the same.
8. Suppose we have fit the following red-line to the following blue dataset representing the global temperature increase of Earth over the past centuries.
1.  Is this visually a good fit in your opinion? Why?  
  No because the data is too clumped and doesnt show an accurate trend.  
2. What type of uncertainty dominates this dataset in the early years (before 1850)?  
  The data is way higher than the red line  
3. Could this dataset be classified as timeseries data? Why?
  Yes because it shows data over time.  
4. We can see a slight rise in temperature anomaly around 1940s, followed by a slight temporary decline in temperature anomaly? What’s the likely reason for the observed trend around this time?  
  Global Warming
9. Can we represent probability as we define in science using integer numbers?  
  No because it needs to be whole numbers.  
10. What consistency criteria are required to define probability?
1.  If a conclusion can be reasoned out in more than one way, then every possible way
must lead to the same result.  
2. We must always consider all the evidence relevant to a question. We should not
arbitrarily ignore some information, basing the conclusions only on what remains.  
3. We must always represent equivalent states of knowledge by equivalent
plausibility assignments. That is, if the state of knowledge is the same (except
perhaps for labeling the propositions) in two problems, then it must assign the
same plausibilities in both.  
11. What is the equivalent of the following binary numbers 1, 01, and 10
 in decimal representation?  
1, 2, 2
12. Are real numbers representable in modern digital computers? Explain you answer.  
  Yes, in binary
14. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?  
Git is a VCS software, GitHub is Git-reprository manager.  
15. Which school(s) of probability theory allow incorporation of expert (prior) knowledge in scientific inference?  
    Classical Probability  
16. When data is scarce, which school of probability theory is the most useful for scientific inference?  
    Classical Probablity  
17. Which school of thought in Probability Theory cannot define or discuss the probability of existence of God? Why?  
Frequentist probability  
18. What is wrong in the following visualization?  
The data goes before 0 which is impossible since the timeline represents age.  
19. Why is everything represented by integers in computers?
