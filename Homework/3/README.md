1. Name the three pillars of Science.  
  Experimental. Theory, Computational+Data  
2. Name and briefly describe three different applications of Computational and Data Sciences.   
   Predictive Data to predict outcomes, Numerical Simulation to predict situations, and machine learning.  
3. Name the two types of scientific reasoning.  
   deductive and plausible reasoning.  
4. What is the difference between observational data and reality?  
  Observational data is information collected through observation. Reality contains information that is observed and not observed.  
5. Name the three stages of scientific inference in the prediction pyramid.   
  Prediction, validation, and calibration  
6. What is a logical proposition?   
  A statement that is either true or false  
7. Can a logical proposition be simultaneously both true and false in deductive reasoning?    
   No. The proposition "it is raining" can only be true or false any rain means it is raining    
8.Does A⇒B necessitate B⇒A?  
   No, For example if it is raining that means the floor is wet, but if the floor is wet that does not mean it is raining.  
12. Provide an example that shows logical implication does not necessarily imply physical causation.  
    It is raining so the streets are wet. Logical implication states that the rain caused wet streets but the streets could be wet from something else so the rain is not the physical causation
