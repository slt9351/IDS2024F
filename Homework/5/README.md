3. what are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
   A form of data visualization making data sets into graphics  
4. Name the two major classes of aesthetics.

5. Name the two major types of data and provide an example for each category.  
   Continuous and Discrete. Continuous data is numbers while discrete is   
6. What is the common name for variables holding qualitative data?

7. Provide examples of ordered and unordered data.  
   Clothing size is an example of ordered data and eye color is an example of unordered data  
8. What are the types of data in the columns of the following table?  
   First column is quantitative, discrete, categorial, ordered   
   Second column is quantitative, discrete, numerical, ordered   
   Third column is qualitative, categorial, dicscrete, ordered  
   Fourth column is qualitative, discrete, ordered  
   Fifth column is quantitative, categorial, continuous, ordered  
9. What kinds of axes in a plot should be represented with the same units and grid size?  
   Linear Axes  
10. Describe an example scenario in which transforming the axes of the plot results in better visualizations.  
   When plotting for data that doubles over time or data that has outliers. If you plot it on a linear graph it will make       the early data indistinquishable. If you transform it, it will become a readable graph.
