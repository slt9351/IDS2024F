3. what are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
   A form of data visualization making data sets into graphics  
4. Name the two major classes of aesthetics.  
   Those that can represent continuous data and those that cannot  
5. Name the two major types of data and provide an example for each category.  
   Continuous and Discrete. Continuous data is numbers while discrete is   
6. What is the common name for variables holding qualitative data?  
   Categorial  
7. Provide examples of ordered and unordered data.  
   Clothing size is an example of ordered data and eye color is an example of unordered data  
8. What are the types of data in the columns of the following table?  
   First column is quantitative, discrete, categorial, ordered   
   Second column is quantitative, discrete, numerical, ordered   
   Third column is qualitative, categorial, dicscrete, ordered  
   Fourth column is qualitative, discrete, ordered  
   Fifth column is quantitative, categorial, continuous, ordered  
9. What kinds of axes in a plot should be represented with the same units and grid size?  
   Linear Axes  
10. Describe an example scenario in which transforming the axes of the plot results in better visualizations.  
   When plotting for data that doubles over time or data that has outliers. If you plot it on a linear graph it will make       the early data indistinquishable. If you transform it, it will become a readable graph.
11. Which one of the following three coordinates are valid and can be used to represent data?  
   All are valid depending on what data set you are using them for. The flat one (e) is best for simple data set whereas the curved one would be good for a map.
12. Name four different color scales and explain their most appropriate usage.    
   Heat color scale would be good for showing temperature on a map. CoolorBrewer Blues would be good for showing degree of       rain on a map. Grays with accent color scale would be good for a data set showing spending habits and labelling them as      good, bad, and neutral.  
13. What is wrong with the following visualization?    
   There is data before 0 which is impossible.  
14.Consider the following color palettes. Which one is more appropriate for effective visualization communications with humans?    
    The first one is better because humans associate red with bad and green with good so anybody could look at it and know       what visual it is trying to communicate.   
 16. Name four major schools of Probability Theory.  
      Classical probability, Bayesian probability, frequentist probability, propensity probability  
17. How many and what living creatures can you identify in this picture?  
   I see two living creatures, a dog and a horse.
18. Move just one matchstick in the following equation to make it hold.  
      I would move the top right matchstick and make the 8 a 6. I would move the matchstick to the top of the 4 to make it 9.
      Then the equation would be 6+3-9=0 which is correct.
